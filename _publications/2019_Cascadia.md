excerpt: 'Slow-slip earthquakes, a special class of earthquake in which slip along a fault occurs over periods of days to years without producing shaking, have increasingly been found to occur in the subsea segments of subduction zones worldwide. There is evidence that these offshore slow-slip earthquakes can occur within the same region where large, damaging earthquakes are generated and that they may precede and potentially trigger these events. Offshore slow-slip earthquakes cause the seafloor to move vertically by up to a few centimeters, which can be detected by measuring the pressure on the seafloor if the effects of ocean tides and circulation can be corrected for. In this study, we search for evidence of slow-slip earthquakes in seafloor pressure data from the Cascadia Subduction Zone, off the U.S. and Canadian west coast, and assess how to best reduce oceanographic signals in these data in order to reliably observe slow-slip deformation. No evidence for these events is seen in Cascadia pressure data from 2011 to 2015. Using a combination of observational data and model simulations, we show that oceanographic signals can be largely eliminated from seafloor pressure measurements if instruments are placed in rows of constant depth. A network of 22 instruments would be sufficient to monitor for large offshore slow-slip earthquakes offshore central Oregon, but smaller events would be difficult to detect with this method. By increasing our ability to detect these slow-slip earthquakes, we can better understand subduction zone processes and their relation to large, damaging megathrust earthquakes.'
