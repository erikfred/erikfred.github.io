Welcome to my little corner of the internet! My goal is for this space to highlight who I am academically, professionally, and personally. In the navigation pane above, you'll find things like my publications and recorded presentations, but also tidbits of more creative endeavors. Before anything else, I want to give a huge thank you to [academicpages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io), for providing and documenting the wonderful tools that make this site a possibility for me.

Academic Bio
======
I am a geophysicist who uses seafloor pressure and other geodetic measurements to study tectonic boundary processes beneath the oceans. My key interests are in increasing the effective resolution of seafloor measurements and optimizing sensor network design to detect increasingly small signals over a range of timescales, with an eye to the transient deformation caused by shallow slow slip.

During my Ph.D. at the University of Washington, I analyzed data from the [Cascadia](https://erikfred.github.io/publication/2019-Cascadia) and [Alaska](https://erikfred.github.io/publication/2023-Alaska) subduction zones to develop techniques for de-noising seafloor pressure records by identifying and exploiting patterns of spatial coherence in the oceanographic pressure field. I further conducted forward modeling of slip on the subduction interface and detectability analyses of synthetic slow slip signals to demonstrate the thresholds of detectability, suggesting the absence of resolvable slow slip in these data and providing design recommendations for future networks aimed at ascertaining the presence of slow slip. I have also worked on mid ocean ridge systems, testing a [novel tiltmeter on Axial Seamount](https://erikfred.github.io/publication/2024-SCTA) on the Juan de Fuca Ridge to characterize the ongoing volcanic inflation there.

At the UT-Austin Institute for Geophysics, I am applying these processing techniques to pressure datasets from the Hikurangi Subduction zone, where offshore slow slip is found to occur regularly. Here, I am collaborating with UTIG oceanographers and geophysicists to improve the oceanographic corrections through the use of circulation models and expand the deformation modeling by using realistic material properties. Together, these new techniques will allow for better characterization of seafloor deformation signals and better interpretation of what those signals imply about movement on the subduction thrust.
