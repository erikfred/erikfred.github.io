I TA'd this course for a total of 3 quarters, in the winters of 2018-2020. This was a ~30 person class in which we considered the many ways in which human society interacts with the ocean -- not limited to scientific applications -- and the ways in which those different facets intersected one another. Regular class meetings were centered around discussion of assigned reading material, and students spent the bulk of the quarter building towards an individual or group project that explored one of the course's focus areas in greater detail. My primary duties as TA were to curate reading material, lead online and in-class discussions, and guide students in their term projects.
