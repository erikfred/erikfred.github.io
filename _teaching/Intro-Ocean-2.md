I TA'd this 100-student course in the autumn of 2020. This was an introduction to oceanography for non-majors, in which we used the Puget Sound and eastern Pacific Ocean as case studies of basic physical, chemical, biological, and geological processes. My primary duties as TA were to design, run, and evaluate the weekly lab section of the course. The University of Washington was conducting all courses completely remote at this time, so this entailed re-thinking the lab materials from the ground up so that they would be engaging and educational even when held entirely over Zoom.
